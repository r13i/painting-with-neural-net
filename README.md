# painting-with-neural-net
Project to train a neural network to paint using TensorFlow.

### Description
In this project I build a multi-layer perceptron fed with pixel position as training data and corresponding RGB colors as labels. I use TensorFlow to build the graph and run training / test processes.

### Result

##### Input image:

![Input image](./astronaut.jpg "An astronaut image used as input")

##### Progress made through iterations:
